## Background

The Census Bureau began the Household Pulse Survey to measure the impacts of the Coronavirus Pandemic on the U.S. Household Population.

## Getting the data

This analysis will be based around using the Public Use File (PUF). The PUF contains the person-level responses to the survey and can be used to produce custom estimates. The PUFs for each week are published at https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/household-pulse-survey/datasets.html. 

The code below will download and unzip the data.


## Working with the data

```{r}
library(forcats)
library(srvyr)
library(tidyverse)
```

First, we read in the PUF.
